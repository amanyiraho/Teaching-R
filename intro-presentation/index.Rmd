# What is R?

- R is an Open Source and free programming language for
statistical computing and graphics.

- Available for Windows, Mac, and Linux

- R can be easily extended with ‚Äúpackages‚Äù:



---

# Why R?

- Free and open source 

- The community &#x1F468;&#x200D;&#x1F4BB;

- One of the most popular tools for data analysis

- Can develop Web applications, dashboards, automatic reports, APIs, 

   **This Presentation was created using R** 

- Can easily integrate with other Languages Python, SQL, JavaScript, CSS

## Lets dive into actual R

---

## Simple baisc R code
```r
8 + 8

## [1] 16
```

```r
sum(2, 2, 4)

## [1] 8

```

```r
1==1
## [1] TRUE
```

# Create R rojects

Install packages

**What is a package?**

```r
install.packages(‚Äôggplot2‚Äô)
```
Load packages
```r
library(ggplot2)
```
**How do you know a package exists?**

> CRAN, Google, and being part of the in the community  

**What is a function?**

```r
?ggplot
?geom_bar
```

---

## Lets plot a graph with ggplot2

**looking how to create a dataframe**

_Wait, what is a dataframe?_


```{r eval=T}
sn <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10) 

weight <-  c(80, 70, 65.5, 50, 120, 72, 80, 70, 60, 77)

age <-  c(30,30, 31, 33, 33, 33, 35, 36, 37, 34 )

age_data <- data.frame(sn , weight, age )

kableExtra::kable(head(age_data, 4),  format = 'html')
```

---

## Basic ggplot2

```{r eval=T}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(data = age_data,   mapping = aes(x = age, y = weight)) +
  geom_point()
 
```

## Wait cooome on, that's boring!!

**Lets use Public Health data!!**

### Lets import some sormas data into R

*Tips* 

1. You should know your working directory use `getwd()` function
1. From there use that path to locate your data
1. Make sure you know how your data is structured 


#### Importing data

```{r}
sormas_measles_data_messy <- read.csv("/Volumes/Robinson/R projects/Teaching-R/intro-presentation/data/sormas_mealses_cases_2021.csv")
kableExtra::kable( head(sormas_measles_data_messy))
```

---

### This is the power of a programming language you don't have to delete the first 2 row all the time.


```{r}

sormas_measles_data <- read.csv("/Volumes/Robinson/R projects/Teaching-R/intro-presentation/data/sormas_mealses_cases_2021.csv",
                                skip = 2)

kableExtra::kable( head(sormas_measles_data))

```

---

class: middle center

## Lets answer some Public Health Questions with the sormas data

Qn 1: What is the number of Women and Men are in this dataset?

Qn 2: Which age-groups exist and how many are they ?

Qn 3: Which State has the highest number of vaccinated individuals?

**You can suggest yours!!**

---
class: middle 

## Do you see that we need to find a way to manipulate the data.
For example for the above questions:

1. We need to find a way to count Women and Men in the dataset

2. Find all unique age-groups and count them.

3. Filter the dataset by those who are vaccinated and then count by state.

### R langunge Basics!!

---
## Basic Operators 
*(Some are like the excel Operators)*

```
## Arithmetic  operators
2 + 2
2/2
2*2
2^2
23 %% 2 # Remainder -> 1

## Logical operators
2 == 2
42 >= 2
2 <= 42
2 != 42
```
---

## R facts

```
x <- 10 # Assigment operator

#[1] 10

y <- 1:x # Sequence

#  [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10

```
indexing in R starts from one (1) **NOT** like python, or C which starts with zero (0)

```
y[0]     #indexing using zero (0) doesn't work it returns a zero integer
#integer(0)

y[1] # Element selection starts with one (1)
```

---

## Data types

```r
1L # integer
1.0 # numeric
‚Äô1‚Äô # character
TRUE == 1 # logical
FALSE == 0 # logical
NA # NA
factor() # factor

#You can check to see what type a variable is with class(x) or
is.numeric(), is.character(),# etc

```
