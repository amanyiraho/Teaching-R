# What is R?

- R is an Open Source and free programming language for
statistical computing and graphics.

- Available for Windows, Mac, and Linux

- R can be easily extended with ‚Äúpackages‚Äù:

- Used to perform interesting tasks such as linear regression, logistic regression, time series, statistical inference, and much more. 

- used for creating data visuals, reports, geographical analysis and web applications.


---

# Why R?

- Free and open source 

- The community &#x1F468;&#x200D;&#x1F4BB;


- One of the most popular tools for data analysis

- Can develop Web applications, dashboards, automatic reports, APIs, 

   **This Presentation was created using R** 

- Can easily integrate with other Languages Python, SQL, JavaScript, CSS

## Lets plot a graph with ggplot2

**looking how to create a dataframe**

_Wait, what is a dataframe?_


```{r eval=T}
sn <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10) 

weight <-  c(80, 70, 65.5, 50, 120, 72, 80, 70, 60, 77)

age <-  c(30,30, 31, 33, 33, 33, 35, 36, 37, 34 )

age_data <- data.frame(sn , weight, age )

kableExtra::kable(head(age_data, 4),  format = 'html')
```

---

## Basic ggplot2

```{r eval=T}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(data = age_data,   mapping = aes(x = age, y = weight)) +
  geom_point()
 
```

## Wait cooome on, that's boring!!

**Lets use Public Health data!!**

![Message was not clear](https://media.giphy.com/media/c8RnNkhxXUhGkkpjJO/giphy.gif)

### Lets import some sormas data into R

*Tips* 

1. You should know your working directory use `getwd()` function
1. From there use that path to locate your data
1. Make sure you know how your data is structured 


#### Importing data

```{r}
sormas_measles_data_messy <- read.csv("/Volumes/Robinson/R projects/Teaching-R/intro-presentation/data/sormas_mealses_cases_2021.csv")
kableExtra::kable( head(sormas_measles_data_messy))
```

---

### This is the power of a programming language you don't have to delete the first 2 row all the time.


```{r}

sormas_measles_data <- read.csv("/Volumes/Robinson/R projects/Teaching-R/intro-presentation/data/sormas_mealses_cases_2021.csv",
                                skip = 2)

kableExtra::kable( head(sormas_measles_data))

```

---

class: middle center

## Lets answer some Public Health Questions with the sormas data

Qn 1: What is the number of Women and Men are in this dataset?

Qn 2: Which age-groups exist and how many are they ?

Qn 3: Which State has the highest number of vaccinated individuals?

**You can suggest yours!!**

---
class: middle 

## Do you see that we need to find a way to manipulate the data.
For example for the above questions:

1. We need to find a way to count Women and Men in the dataset

2. Find all unique age-groups and count them.

3. Filter the dataset by those who are vaccinated and then count by state.

## Data Types and Structures in R

### Understanding Data Types

The best and right way to start your journey learning R programming language is to have a solid understanding of data types and structures and when to use them.

To begin, **remember that in R, everything is an object**.


---

## a)  Character 
 
symbols, letters, words or phrases in single or double quotation marks

```r
"bread"

'coffee'

"12"

"I need 2 cups of coffee."

```

```{r}
class("12") 
typeof("12") 

```

---

## b)  numeric

```r
1

123

12.3

```
```{r}

class(12.3) 
typeof(123) 
```

---

## c)  Integer 

a special case of numeric data, discrete values like unique identifiers eg. student id. To store a value as an integer, we need to specify it as such. Integers are usually followed by the capital 'L' notation to denote the data type.

```r
12

100

10L

```
```{r}
class(100) 
typeof(10L) 
```

---

## d)  logical - logical or boolean values i.e. TRUE or FALSE.

```r
FALSE
TRUE
```

```{r}
class(TRUE) 
```


---

## Summary about data types

```r
1L # integer
1.0 # numeric
‚Äô1‚Äô # character
TRUE == 1 # logical
FALSE == 0 # logical
NA # NA
factor() # factor

#You can check to see what type a variable is with class(x) or
is.numeric(), is.character(),# etc

```

---

## R facts

```r
x <- 10 # Assigment operator

#[1] 10

y <- 1:x # Sequence

#  [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10

```
indexing in R starts from one (1) **NOT** like python, or C which starts with zero (0)

```r
y[0]     #indexing using zero (0) doesn't work it returns a zero integer
#integer(0)

y[1] # Element selection starts with one (1)
```


---

## Functions in R

### Why functions?

-   automate common tasks

-   named function making codes easier to understand.

-   update code easily when requirements or tasks are changed.

-   eliminate copy and paste of same codes in multiple places in a single script

> **We shall get back to functions is a big topic**

## Building Block
 
 The elements of each of these data types can be combined to form data structures, such as data frames, atomic vectors, etc.

---
class: middle center

## Understanding Data structures

Data structures are a  means of organizing data for effective use. 
This helps to reduce the challenges faced in managing space and performance of our codes.

As with other programming languages, in R programming language, different variables are used to store different data which are stored in reserved area in the system memory.


In this section, we will be covering the **some** of the data structures in R:

---

## 1.  Vectors


```{r}
#c()

my_vector <- c("bags", "shoes", "wrist-watch", "money")

my_vector
```

--

```{r}
my_alphabets <- letters[1:10]

my_alphabets

```

---

## 2.  Lists

```{r}
# lists
a = c(2, 3, 5) 
b = c("aa", "bb", "cc", "dd", "ee") 
c = c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE) 
my_list = list(a, b, c, 3, "My name")   # my_list contains copies of a,b,c,3
```

--

```{r}
# The following is a slice containing the second member of my_list, which is a copy of b.
my_list[2]
```

--

```{r}
# Member Reference
# In order to reference a list member directly, we have to use the double square bracket "[[]]" operator. 
# The following object my_list[[2]] is the second member of my_list. 
# In other words, my_list[[2]] is a copy of b, but is not a slice containing b or its copy.

my_list[[2]]
```

---

## 3.  Data Frames

**Create a data frame**
```{r}
# Create a data frame
my_df_no_colnames <- data.frame(
 student_name = c("John", "Buba"),
  Gender = c(2,3)
)
my_df_no_colnames 
```

--

**Assign col names**

```{r}
names(my_df_no_colnames) <- c("Student", "Sex")
my_df_no_colnames
```

---
## Create data frame from a vector

```{r}
# Vectors
student_names <- c("Michael", "Bello", "Tonye", "Tayo","Yusuf", "Success", "Aisha")
gender <- c("M","M","F","F","M","M", "F")

# create a Data frame
# 
my_df <- data.frame(student_names,gender)
my_df
```

--

```{r}
class(my_df)
```


---
## 4. Tibble
 Create a tibble
```{r}
#tibble(1:5, c("a", "b", "c", "d", "e"))

# Check this out! What went wrong?
#tibble(1:5, c("a","d","e")) 
```

---
 ## Create tibble with named columns
```{r}
name = c("john", "alexis", "Steph", "Quiera")
age  = c(24, 44, 26, 25)

my_tbl <- tibble(
  name = c("jojo", "sofia", "robin", "sisie"),
  age  = c(14, 13, 16, 15)
)

```


```{r}
my_tbl <- tibble(name,age)
# Print my_df to the screen
my_tbl

```

---

## Basic Operators 
*(Some are like the excel Operators)*

``` r
## Arithmetic  operators
2 + 2
2/2
2*2
2^2
23 %% 2 # Remainder -> 1
```

```r
## Logical operators
2 == 2
42 >= 2
2 <= 42
2 != 42
```
---

# üö•

## Control statements
 Loops, if statements, repeat, switch

---

## for loop
 
 A for loop is used to iterate over a vector in R programming.

```r
for (val in 1:5){
  # statement 
  print(val)
} 

for (num in c(1,2,3,4,5)) {  
  print(num + 2)
}                      

```
--

```{r}

x <- c(2,5,3,9,8,11,6)
count <- 0
for (val in x) {
  if(val %% 3 == 0)  
    count = count+1
}
print(count)

```

---

### while loop - used to loop until a specific condition is met.
```{r}
w <- 5
while (w < 10) {
  print(w)
  w <-  w+1
}
```


---

## if statements

```r
a = 10
b = 40

if(a!=b){

"a is not equal to b"

}else{
"a is equal to b"

}

## options
if_else(a!=b, "a is not equal to b", "a is equal to b")
ifelse(a!=b, "a is not equal to b", "a is equal to b")
```
